abstract: This work presents a reliable mechanism for early illness identification in the context of the worldwide healthcare difficulties brought on by Alzheimer's disease. This work apply deep learning techniques using a large dataset of high-quality brain MRI images that includes people with Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal patients divided into "Moderate Demented," "Mild Demented," "Very Mild Demented," and "Non Demented" classes. To create an automated diagnostic system, this work specifically use four transfer learning architecturesâ€”EfficientNetV2B3, InceptionNetV3, NASNetMobile and MobileNetV2 as base models. EfficientNetV2B3 model underwent thorough training and evaluation and was directed by important measures like loss and accuracy ultimately showed highest diagnostic accuracy of 97.42%. This dataset and model combination, supported by the Weights and Biases platform for real-time monitoring and metric logging, hold promise in advancing early Alzheimer's disease detection and improving patient outcomes, addressing the significant societal and healthcare challenges related to this condition. The proposed work is also compared with previous published work to demonstrate its significance.
