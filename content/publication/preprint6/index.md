abstract: Pothole-ridden roads contribute significantly to vehicular accidents and pose a threat to both drivers and pedestrians globally. In India alone, over 26,000 accidents occurred due to potholes within a span of four years. Besides causing physical harm, potholes also lead to substantial repair costs and continuous maintenance demands, causing traffic congestion and increased travel times. To address this growing concern, this paper presents a novel approach to pothole detection using deep learning techniques. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of object detection frameworks such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), specifically YOLOv8 models, we propose an automated system to accurately locate and identify road anomalies. Our approach achieved a high mean average precision (mAP) of 91% using a threshold of 0.5. By conducting a comprehensive literature review, implementing state-of-the-art models, and evaluating results through a comparative study, this paper provides valuable insights into how high-precision pothole detection can benefit society. Our work demonstrates the potential for deep learning to substantially reduce the risks and impacts associated with potholes, paving the way for safer and more efficient roadways in the future.
