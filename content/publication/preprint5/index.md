abstract: The precise classification of medicinal plants is of crucial importance, as they represent an essential source of traditional and alternative medicine for a variety of ailments. In order to avoid potential misapplications and associated risks, accurate classification is essential. This study is based on a large dataset of Bangladeshi medicinal leaves representing a wide variety of species and ailments. As part of our research approach, we leverage pre-trained neural network models to extract and recognize features using transfer learning principles. In terms of accuracy and robustness, we achieve notable results. MobileNetV2 leads with an impressive accuracy rate of 91.46%, closely followed by InceptionV3 at 96.68%, ResNet152V2 at 94.78%, Xception at 95.73%, DenseNet201 at 98.10%, and NASNetMobile at 97.63%. Hence, this paper achieved best results using DenseNet201 giving us an impressive accuracy of 98.10%. This comparative analysis serves to elucidate the strengths and weaknesses inherent in these models, offering valuable insights for practitioners contemplating the utilization of transfer learning in the context of medicinal leaf classification. Notably, our proposed model achieves a substantial 8% increase in accuracy compared to existing methodologies. This advancement underscores the potential significance of our approach in advancing the field of medicinal plant classification. The accurate identification and classification of medicinal plants hold the promise of elevating healthcare practices and facilitating the responsible management of these invaluable botanical resources, both within Bangladesh and on a global scale.
