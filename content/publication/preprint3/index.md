abstract: Detecting fire safety equipment plays a crucial role in safeguarding lives and property. Detecting objects has a substantial impact on reducing and preventing fire-related risks. Early fire detection, prompt response, property and life protection, regulatory compliance, insurance needs fulfillment, and improving overall fire safety are all enhanced by discovering fire safety equipment. Recent advances in deep learning have catalyzed transitive progress in detecting fire safety equipment. This paper proposes using YOLOv3 and YOLOv5, state-of-the-art deep learning models, to predict and detect fire safety equipment in complex environments. Through a carefully selected dataset, the research explores the multi-scale detection capabilities of these models and their potential to revolutionize fire safety. Fire safety equipment of varying sizes and dimensions in various environments can be identified efficiently using YOLO-based architectures. YOLOv3 produced the highest mAP score 93.8\% after several experiments. As a result of fusing deep learning technology with critical safety concerns, this work showcases a substantial improvement in detection accuracy.
