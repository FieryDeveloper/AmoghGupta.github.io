            During my internship, I actively participated in red-teaming initiatives to identify safety limitations and vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs). This included successfully jailbreaking over seven models—such as Claude (Sonnet and Haiku), ChatGPT, Gemini, and others—using advanced multilingual custom prompt techniques. I contributed to developing and refining strategies to improve model robustness and ethical alignment. Additionally, I built custom Python scripts for automating output evaluation and supported research efforts by proposing novel ideas and contributing to project objectives.

           During my internship, I worked on two core projects involving Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. I implemented advanced text summarization techniques to condense a dataset of 3,000 tweets into the most relevant 40, using large language models and integer linear programming to enhance summarization accuracy and efficiency. In another project focused on flood detection, I applied image segmentation techniques to improve classification performance and support more effective data analysis.
